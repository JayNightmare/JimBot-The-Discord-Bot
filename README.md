# JimBot-The-Discord-Bot

JimBot the DIscord Bot is a open-source, low effort bot that deals with (at the moment) simple commands. 

**Current Commands:**
- Kick
- Ban and Unban
- Timeouts
- Purge (Not yet supported)

**Future Commands:**
- ChatGPT chatbot intergation
- ChefGPT cooking intergation
- Welcome

- Image generation

The bot is only being worked on by me and most of this stuff is from what I have learned from watching YT video lmao. 

# Goal

I want this bot to eventually replace the current Mee6 bot and to use for university discord servers and clubs. The bots goal is to make the uni discord easier to manage and navigate. 

It will do this by doing the following:
- Bot will ask what channel is for logs/moderators. It will send log messages there.
- It will state it function to the chat using embeded messages. Giving all available commands.
- While that message is being sent, the bot will make itself a role, give it the color black and rename itself to have the prefix in "[]" than its name. For example, ```[prefix] JimBot```
- Bot must be run on dedicated server, maybe a server run by the uni or a personal cloud-based server.
